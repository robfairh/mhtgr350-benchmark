SM comments:

If you update your MOOSE to the latest version, you gotta use the FileMeshGenerator object for your mesh.
Two of your files don't have a newline at the end of file which could fail PEP8 or C style tests if they're python/C files.
Just fyi since I noticed it happens when I edit files using certain editors on Windows

@robfairh I also noticed that PJFNK doesn't work well with Moltres runs and asm is really slow.
I've had some success with hypre and boomeramg on my desktop but not on BW.
Also, you should try -pc_factor_mat_solver_package with superlu_dist or mumps on BW when you're using a lot of nodes.
